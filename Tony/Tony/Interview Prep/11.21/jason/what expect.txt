“That’s a great question — and one I’ve actually thought about quite a bit.”

In my next role, I’m looking for three main things — impact, innovation, and collaboration.

First, impact — I want to build systems that matter.
LATCH’s focus on supporting federal digital modernization really resonates with me because I enjoy solving problems that have a real-world mission attached — where a more secure, automated system directly supports the people behind it.
As they say, “Technology should serve purpose, not just process.”

Second, innovation — I thrive in environments where I can explore new tech responsibly — whether it’s leveraging AI-driven automation, Azure Functions, or agentic frameworks to modernize workflows.
I like to stay curious — the kind of person who reads about new Azure releases like they’re movie spoilers.

And third, collaboration — I expect to be part of a team that values open communication, mentorship, and shared accountability.
I’ve led cross-functional teams before, and I’ve learned that the best systems are built when engineers and architects aren’t afraid to say, “Let’s test that theory together.”
Or, as one of my mentors liked to say, “A good engineer debugs code; a great one debugs people’s assumptions.”

Overall, I’m looking for a space where I can contribute as both a builder and a problem-solver — someone who helps bridge cloud architecture, automation, and AI integration — while growing with a team that shares LATCH’s belief in quality, security, and bold thinking.
