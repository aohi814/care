“Good morning, Stacey! It’s great to finally meet you. Thanks for having me today.”

I’m Jason Littleton, a Senior .NET Developer and Systems Engineer with over a decade of hands-on experience designing and delivering secure, cloud-native enterprise systems — the kind that keep the lights on and the servers happy even on Monday mornings.

For the past few years, I’ve been leading development at TCI Technologies, where I’ve architected .NET 8 and Blazor-based microservices, deployed across Azure, AWS, and GCP — with a sprinkle of GraphQL magic, container orchestration, and enough CI/CD automation to make DevOps folks smile.

Before that, I worked with FocusApps and Sunflower Lab, building enterprise-grade platforms that blended .NET Core, Angular, React, and AEM to create dynamic, scalable user experiences. Along the way, I also got to mentor teams, streamline deployment pipelines, and make performance tuning feel like a competitive sport.

If I had to summarize my work philosophy, I’d borrow the old proverb:

“Measure twice, deploy once.”
I believe clean architecture, automation, and communication are the real three pillars of great engineering — not just code.

What drew me to LATCH is your commitment to empowering clients through systems engineering and technical assistance (SETA), and your focus on federal modernization with AI-driven automation and cloud architecture.
It aligns perfectly with what I’ve been doing — bridging modern .NET systems, Azure functions, and intelligent automation frameworks to build solutions that are not just functional but future-proof.

And honestly, any company that encourages people to “think audaciously” instantly has my attention.
I’ve always believed that in engineering — just like in life — “fortune favors the well-documented and version-controlled.”

So, I’m excited about the chance to bring my technical experience, leadership, and a bit of humor to LATCH — helping modernize systems while keeping things secure, efficient, and maybe even a little fun along the way.
