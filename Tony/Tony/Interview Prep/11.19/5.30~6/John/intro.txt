“Thank you, Jana, I’m excited to talk with you today.
I’m John Paul Kee, a Staff Software Engineer with strong experience building scalable, high-performance platforms across fintech, AI-driven engagement systems, and cloud-native microservices. Over the past several years, I’ve led development in Ruby on Rails, Golang, .NET Core, and modern cloud stacks—designing distributed systems, event-driven architectures, and real-time processing pipelines that serve millions of users.”

“A big part of my recent work has been building secure, fault-tolerant backend services, optimizing complex SQL queries, designing high-throughput APIs, and architecting microservices on Kubernetes and AWS—including SQS/SNS-based event workflows, containerized deployments, and zero-downtime CI/CD pipelines. I’ve also delivered polished frontend features using React, JavaScript, and modern UX patterns to ensure seamless user experiences.”

“What really attracted me to DigniFi is the blend of engineering challenge and mission impact. Building real-time credit decision engines, millisecond-response financing systems, and dealership-facing interfaces aligns perfectly with the kind of high-stakes, performance-driven systems I’ve been leading. And I love the fact that the work directly helps people get essential car repairs—there’s purpose behind the technology.”

“I’m excited to learn more about your engineering culture and discuss how my background in scalable architecture, event-driven systems, and full-stack development can contribute to DigniFi’s next generation of financing products.”
