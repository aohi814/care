“I expect three things: meaningful work, strong engineering collaboration, and real impact. I want to contribute to a product that protects user privacy, work in an open-source environment that values high-quality code and peer review, and continue growing as a senior iOS engineer by solving hard problems in performance, security, and browser architecture. Brave’s mission and engineering culture match exactly what I’m looking for.”
