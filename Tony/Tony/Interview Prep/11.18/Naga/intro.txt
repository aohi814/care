“Absolutely, and thank you for the opportunity. I’m Naga Kadali, a Senior iOS Engineer with more than nine years of experience building secure, scalable, and high-performance mobile applications across banking, fintech, healthcare, logistics, and insurance.

I specialize in Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, and have deep experience maintaining and modernizing large iOS codebases, including refactoring legacy Objective-C into modern Swift. At Wells Fargo, PNC, and Citi, I helped lead major mobile modernization initiatives — focusing on architecture (MVVM, dependency injection, modularization), performance optimization using Xcode Instruments, and security features such as Face ID / Touch ID, MFA, Keychain encryption, data protection, and compliance with PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2.

I also have hands-on experience with C++ and Objective-C++, especially when integrating native modules, which aligns well with Brave’s mixed Swift / C++ / WebKit tech stack.

Since many enterprise apps I worked on had cross-platform components, I’ve contributed to shared frameworks built in React Native + TypeScript, and have also worked in fully distributed teams across engineering, design, and security — similar to Brave’s fully remote, open-source environment.

What excites me most about Brave is the mission: building a faster, more private, user-first web. I’ve worked for years on apps that prioritize security and privacy, and I love Brave’s approach of building an open-source browser, a completely independent search engine, and privacy-first user experiences.

I’m really excited about the chance to contribute to the Brave iOS browser, help push the app’s performance and security forward, and collaborate with the engineering and open-source community.”
