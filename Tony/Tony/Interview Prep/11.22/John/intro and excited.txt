“Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. My name is John Paul Kee, and my last role is a Staff Software Engineer at Meta. And I finished my last position because the contract had expired, and now I am here with you. I have a little over 10 years of experience leading and building production systems using Ruby on Rails, Golang, and modern cloud-native architectures.
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia, where I studied from 2012 to 2017.
Most recently at Meta, I served as a Staff Engineer, where I led full-stack and backend initiatives for AI-powered customer engagement and payment recovery platforms. Before that at Microsoft, I built and scaled multiple enterprise-grade systems—including healthcare communication tools, digital signage platforms, and financial analytics systems—primarily using Ruby on Rails, Golang microservices, PostgreSQL, and event-driven workflows.

⭐ Team Configuration & My Role

Across my recent roles, I typically worked in cross-functional squads of:

6 engineers (mix of backend, frontend, and data engineers)

1 product manager

1 designer or UX lead

1 QA automation engineer

As a Staff Engineer, my role included:

Leading architectural direction for Rails and Golang services

Defining API contracts, RFCs, and integration patterns

Mentoring mid-level and senior engineers

Pair-programming with teammates to unblock complex technical issues

Driving platform-wide improvements such as performance tuning, schema optimization, service modularization, and observability

⭐ How I Communicate & Collaborate

My communication style is very intentional, especially in remote-first environments. I typically collaborate using:

Asynchronous communication (Slack, Jira, GitHub) for technical decisions, design docs, and proposals

Daily standups / weekly planning to align tasks and unblock cross-team dependencies

Architecture review sessions where I lead discussions around API contracts, event models, and database schema changes

1:1 mentoring for guidance on Rails best practices, service boundaries, and testing strategy

Cross-functional collaboration with security, SRE, product, and compliance—critical in healthcare or HIPAA environments

At Meta and Microsoft, I made sure communication remained clear, solution-focused, and accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

⭐ Why This Role at SonderMind

SonderMind’s mission really resonates with me. I’ve spent several years building healthcare communication platforms, HIPAA-compliant APIs, patient engagement systems, and event-driven architectures using Rails, RabbitMQ/Kafka, and secure identity flows. This role aligns perfectly with the kind of work I’m passionate about—designing healthcare-centric APIs, simplifying partner integrations, and ensuring secure, high-quality workflows around scheduling, eligibility, claims, and interoperability.

I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my experience to SonderMind and help shape developer-facing APIs and FHIR-based integrations in a meaningful way.”
